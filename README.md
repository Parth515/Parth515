# 🐍 100 Days of Python: A Side Quest

This is my personal challenge to stay sharp and consistent with Python through 100 days of coding.  
Inspired by the #100DaysOfCode, this side quest is about deepening my Python fluency while experimenting with ideas, mini-projects, and notebooks.
Starting with small, easy to do script, then increasing difficulty level.

📆 Goal: 100 days of learning, building, and exploring Python.
🎯 Focus: Core Python, problem-solving, OOP, scripting, and more.
